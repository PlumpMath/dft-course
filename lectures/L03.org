* Notes on exporting.
I have MikTeX 2.9 installed. To export the syntax highlighted code, you must enable the execution of external commands.

In my git bash shell I ran:

#+begin_src sh
initexmf --edit-config-file=miktex/config/pdflatex.ini
#+end_src

which opened up notepad. I put this line in the file:
#+begin_example
EnableWrite18=t
#+end_example

Saved the file and closed it. Now, I can export this file by typing =C-c C-e d= and I get a pdf file.
