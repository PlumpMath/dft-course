* Convergence study of tantalum
** Planewave cutoff convergence
Determine the planewave cutoff energy required to achieve a total energy convergence of 10 meV for bcc tantalum at its experimental lattice constant. Use a k-point grid of 10 \times 10 \times 10, and the PBE exchange correlation functional.

** k-point grid convergence
Determine the Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid required to achieve a total energy convergence of 50 meV for bcc tantalum at its experimental lattice constant. Use a planewave cutoff of 350 eV for this study.

* Convergence study of graphite
** Planewave convergence
Determine the planewave cutoff energy required to get convergence of 10 meV or better for graphite at its equilibrium lattice constant. Use a k-point grid of (6,6,6) for this study.

** k-point convergence
Determine the k-point grid required to get convergence of 50 meV or better for graphite at its equilibrium lattice constant. Use a planewave cutoff of 350 eV for this study.

* Determine the DFT lattice constant of bcc tantalum
Use the parameters you estimated in the previous problem. Construct an equation of state and determine the lattice constant and bulk modulus of tantalum. Compare your answers to literature values, and cite the source of your comparison.

* Determine the DFT lattice constant of fcc tantalum
Construct an equation of state to determine the lattice constant of fcc tantalum. You can assume the same parameters that were good for the bcc structure are good for the fcc structure. Which structure is more stable, fcc or bcc?

* Determine graphite lattice parameters
The crystal structure of graphite can be found at http://cst-www.nrl.navy.mil/lattice/struk/a9.html (or you can use the builtin mod:ase functions).

Compute the geometry optimized total energy for graphite. Use parameters determined from the convergence study to ensure the total energy is converged to better than 50 meV. Compare your results to experimental data. Cite your source.

* Tantalum carbide lattice parameters
Tantalum carbide is a hard material. Use DFT to compute the lattice constant of cubic tantalum carbide in the rock salt structure (NaCl or B1), and the bulk modulus. The crystal structure of tantalum carbide can be found at http://cst-www.nrl.navy.mil/lattice/struk/b1.html or in the mod:ase.lattice module. Compare the bulk modulus of the TaC to that of bcc tantalum. Which is harder?

The experimental lattice constant is 4.455 \AA, and the experimental bulk modulus is 3.45 Mbar. How do your results compare to this?

* Estimate the formation energy of TaC.
Compute the formation energy of TaC for the reaction Ta + C_{graphite} $\rightarrow$ TaC. Compare your anser to the value reported in http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100786a027. Discuss any reasons for discrepancy. Remember that you must use the same ENCUT for all the calculations in this problem, and you must use the largest ENCUT for all calculations that ensures the accuracy level you want.
